# YelpCamp-Project

 The YelpCamp Project was deployed in the [Heroku platform](https://arcane-retreat-28149.herokuapp.com/). The app makes use of full CRUD operations, for campgrounds and reviews. You just need to register and login, in order to access those funcionalities.

 The virtual environment makes use of the [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) cloud database. Everytyhing that you create, will be stored there, and when you delete one of those, it will be deleted from the database.
